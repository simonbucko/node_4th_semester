    <h2 class="main-title">What is a Template Engine?</h2>
    <p>A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values and transforms the template into the HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design the HTML page.
      A template engine is a tool that enables Frontend/Fullstack developers to write HTML markup, prepared with its(the template engineâ€™s) defined tags or syntax that will either insert variables into the final output of the template or run some programming logic at run-time before sending the final HTML to the browser for display.
    </p>
    <h2>What is a EJS?</h2>
    <p>EJS simply stands for Embedded Javascript. It is a simple templating language/engine that lets its user generate HTML with plain javascript.
      EJS is mostly useful whenever you have to output HTML with a lot of javascript.
    </p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>To install ejs engine run the command below
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
$ npm install ejs</code>
    </pre>
    <h2>Rendering first HTML</h2>
    <p>Assuming you have NodeJS project created with Express and EJS installed as dependencies create a folder called views
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
$ mkdir views</code>
    </pre>
    <p>Create your HTML file you want to render here and call it home.html
      <br><br>
      Now create a app.js file and insert code below:
      <pre>
        <code>
  var x = 5;
  var y = 6;
  var z = x + y</code>
      </pre>
