    <h2 class="main-title">JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

    <h2>Variables declaration</h2>
    <p>
      Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values). In JavaScript we can declare variable using these key words:
      <ul>
        <li>var</li>
        <li>const</li>
        <li>let</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
node [FILE_PATH]/yourJS.js</code>
    </pre>
